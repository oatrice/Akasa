# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Telegram Webhook Integration**: Implemented a new endpoint (`POST /api/v1/telegram/webhook`) to receive real-time updates from the Telegram Bot API.
- **Webhook Security**: Added validation for the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header on the webhook endpoint to ensure requests originate from Telegram.
- **Configuration Management**: Created a centralized settings module (`app/config.py`) using `pydantic-settings` to load secrets like `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` from environment variables.
- **Telegram Data Models**: Added Pydantic models (`app/models/telegram.py`) to validate and structure incoming data from the Telegram API.

### Changed
- **Application Startup**: The main FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) now includes the new Telegram router.
- **Dependencies**: Added `pydantic-settings` to `requirements.txt` for improved configuration handling.
